#Ver 1.0

This package right here contains the Line.cs + A prefab already configured + a shader

What It Does:
1. Defines An start and end point for a line renderer
2. Creates 2 aditional joints to make the line a little stylish
3. Defines a threshold for the line to be "eased" (something like this "」" and this "「")
4. there's a shader that allows the line to render on top of everyting to use it as a UI indicator
