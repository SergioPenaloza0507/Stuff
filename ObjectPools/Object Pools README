OBJECT POOLS by Sergio Pe√±aloza

This Package has a pooling system yo implement in any game, you just add the Pool.cs to any game object and assign the prefabs
to the corresponding serialized field

The prefabs need to have any script that implements the IPoolObject Interface where you define how does the object activates and deactivates
